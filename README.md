 My latest project Heart Disease Prediction using supervised machine learning. This project delves into a heart disease dataset, employing logistic regression, a powerful algorithm for binary classification. 

Key Points:
*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I started by diving into the data to understand the characteristics and relationships between various factors like age, BMI, smoking , diabetic, stroke and others. This helped identify potential predictors of heart disease.
*Logistic Regression: I then utilized logistic regression, which models the probability of an event (heart disease in this case) based on independent variables. The model was trained on the data, allowing it to learn the relationships between features and the target variable.
*Results and Insights: The analysis yielded valuable insights into the key factors influencing heart disease risk.
